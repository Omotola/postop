## Iteration 1 Evaluation - Group 19

**Evaluator: [Singh, Shirish](mailto:shirish@jhu.edu)**

### The project idea 
Good motivation for the application. Based on a real problem faced by many medical institutions. This application can make a difference. Articulate the information in a better way to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed application.

### Features
The features are limited regarding functionality. More details and features needed. Integration with the Fitbit/Google Fit API is a major non-CRUD feature. [-2 Points]

### UI sketches
UI sketches are limited to elementary features and do not reflect the core of the application, such as the integration with the third-party APIs (Fitbit/Google Fit). Add more sketches and demonstrate the main activities of the application. [-3 points]

### Use Cases
Use cases need more work. Elaborate the points mentioned under every use case. Add use cases for FitBit/Google Fit API integration and usage. Ensure that more details on the use of patient data are available.

### Architecture
The architecture is clear. Develop a prototype to get the data from Fitbit/Google Fit for the application.

### General Remarks
- Recommended to start early on Android development [UI and Dataflow]. Refer to official Android "Hello World" tutorial: https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/index.html.
- Study the push notification services available for Android, such as Google Cloud Messaging.
- Develop the internal logic for recommending the users to drink water.
- Learn about the third-party APIs for extracting the user's daily activity data.
- Look at the future iteration requirements and plan ahead of time.
