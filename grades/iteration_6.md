# Iteration 6 Evaluation - Group 19 PostOp

### Presentation
(Was the presentation itself done well - was it well-organized, easy to understand, and convincing?)

You were well-organized with your presentation.  Motivation was well presented. Good background for motivation for the app development, a serious issue. Parameters for application clearly defined with support. Technical walk through clearly demonstrated the technology stack.

#### App demo
(Did app work well?  Did any errors arise during the demo?  How did the demo'd implementation line up with features proposed?)

It took awhile to load at start and in general the nurse app goes pretty slowly - was this Heroku?

Login of new user did not work in the demo.

Extended features ave not been implemented. Cannot login in the created account. UI reflects the necessary values. Push notification implemented.

#### UI quality based on the demo
(Was it well-designed? Was it usable?  Did it have glitches?)

Fine

### Testing and Coverage
(Continue to write more tests for new features and keep high coverage?)

90.9% coverage with 4k lines of code - good.

### Build and Deployment and git usage
(Same as previous iterations)

Deployed on Heroku. All good here.

### Non-CRUD feature
(How did it turn out?)

Several things, none are very large however - you come out a bit low here.

### Iteration progress reporting
(Final CHANGELOG.md and project boards updated?)

CHANGELOG and project board has been regularly updated.

### Evaluation of project difficulty
(in terms of lines of code, conceptual difficulty, non-CRUD features, degree of completion)

The project could have been made more complex with some extended features described.

### Overall Remarks

You gave a good pitch for app - it was a practical application.  The main downside is it your app was mostly a database front-end of tables, without all that much logic.  So you needed more features and non-CRUD for four people.

**Grade: 87/100**
