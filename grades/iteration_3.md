# Iteration 3 Evaluation - Group 19

**Evaluator: [Singh, Shirish](mailto:shirish@jhu.edu)**

### Implementation progress
- Good job itegrating GCM and Google Fit API.
- Progress is slow. Only two end points have been developed. [-10 Points]
- Consider adding more test cases to increase code coverage.
- Travis build passes with all the test cases. Nice!

### Design check-in
- You need to reconsider the structure of your application. Make a sequence diagram to understand the flow of data within your entire infrastructure.

### Code Quality
- Backend code qualtiy is good. Well structured code base.
- Android code needs restructuring.
- No comments or javadoc available.

[-3 points]

### Git usage
- All the members have contributed equally.
- Good use of branches.
- All git commit messages seem to be meaning full. However, if possible please add more detail to commit messages.

#### Use of the GitHub issue tracker to manage bugs, features, etc.

- The team uses issue tracker in a very limited way.
- Please use issue tracker to assign bug resolution tasks or to file bugs.

#### Codebase pushed to master on your team's GitHub repository for our inspection

- Codebase pushed to master branch.

### Iteration submission and reporting

- The notification mechanism has been added to the docs.

#### Fully automated build of your project with a README.md describing how to build it
(Could we successfully build the project from the README alone?)

- The version of Java, AndroidStudio, gradle, etc. are not mentioned.
- Always mention the language version in the documents.

[-2 points]

#### Top-level file CHANGELOG.md present in your repo and describes progress in this iteration well

- No CHANGELOG.md file to meet the iteration requirements available [here](https://pl.cs.jhu.edu/oose/projects/iteration3.shtml). [-5 Points]

#### Use of GitHub's project boards to keep track of your progress

- You have used project boards to some extent.
- Plan out things for iteration 5 and 6.

[-5 points]

### Other Remarks

- The team has good momentum now. The next iteration requires a lot of work, let's keep things moving!
- Focus on testing each feature of the Android application from the user's perspective, and as a complete flow.
- Integrate Notifications with your application logic.
- Make sure you cover all the requirements of the iteration before submitting.
- If you develop a module, ask someone else on the team to review your code for quality checks and testing.
- Remember, you get get up to half the back points if you complete the Android application development and testing in iteration 4.

### Grade update

More endpoints created, core re-structuring, changes in Readme.  +10
