# Iteration 5 Evaluation - Group 19

**Evaluator: [Singh, Shirish](mailto:shirish@jhu.edu)**

### Implementation progress
[25 points] (Core app working including non-CRUD integration?  Features filling out?  UI starting to look good even though it still may have some glitches?)

- Implementation of project is almost complete.
- The edit patient does not update the "Diabetic" & "Catheter User" flags. [-2 Points]
- The Gender is Male by default. Allow the user to select from the drop down. [-2 Points]
- When a field in the UI exceeds the database field limit, then the alert is not shown. Basically, there is nothing. [-1 Points]
- You need to consider the seriousness of the application that you are developing. There should not be any obvious bugs, otherwise it will lead to catastrophic damage.
- Consider performing a risk assessment for your application.
- Your code base is small; it goes without saying that the application should be near perfect (Without bugs).

#### Code Quality
[30 points] (Good use of object-oriented design principles in codebase?  Absence of smells in code?)

- Code quality has improved since last iteration.
- No comments for many methods.
- Remove commented code.
- I will reiterate that no method should have "void" return type. Check the Android code too. [-5 Points]

### Testing and Coverage
[20 points] (Continue to write more tests for new features and improve coverage?)

- The purpose of testing is to ensure that your logic is correct and your get the expected response from the components.
- Adding test cases merely to increase the coverage is not correct. I can still think of at least 10 tests that you should write. 

#### Fully automated build of your project with a README.md describing how to build it
[5 points] (Same as previous iteration)

- Clear building instructions have been provided in README.md file.

### Deployment
[5 points] (Same as previous iteration)

- Deployed on Heroku.

### Advanced Git usage
[10 points] (Same as previous iteration)

### Iteration submission and reporting

#### CHANGELOG.md updated and project boards updated, filling in goals for iteration 6
[10 points]

- CHANGELOG.md has been updated to reflect the new changes in the iteration.

### Other Remarks

- Good work with the project!
- Considering that your application is complete. Use Sonar (Code Quality Analysis Tool) to check your code for further improvements.

### Grade update

Nurse UI changes have been made, removal of void return type +5


**Grade: 95/100**
